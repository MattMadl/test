     <p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px; margin-top: 40px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">My inspiration for this project stems from my recent newfound interest in National Parks and environment conservation. I was inspired by multimedia works like Trevor Robert's Mystery Flesh Pit National Park. This bestiary was created as my final project for my my first of two capstone courses. The course had a heavy focus on english literature through the lens of animal studies. The Mason's Rift National Park world is a creation of of my own that explores the idea of an interdimensional national park. I plan to build upon this world with more projects spanning across various forms of digital media. Click the image above to see the bestiary.</p>

       <p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px; margin-top: 40px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Sizzle is an app devised by the teamwork of me and my fellow classmates, highlighting my ability to work in a team and take on a leadership role. Through careful consideration, our group decided to develop the user interface for that we know college students would enjoy. Sizzle allows students to air out their complaints anonymously. We considered the idea that not all students may agree with each complaint, so we added a user affordance that allows for upvoting and downvoting. Each upvote makes the post heat up or “sizzle” and each downvote makes the post cool down or be doused. To learn more about this work, click on the image above.</p>

     <p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px; margin-top: 40px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">The 2021-22 NFL season was a one of intrigue for statistic gurus. I found it hard to believe the fact that a receiver that had statistically the greatest season of all time would be virtually ignored in voting for the most coveted seasonal award other than the Super Bowl itself. I explored stats using sites like Pro Football Reference to understand why it has become impossible for players to win the Most Valuable Player award without being a quarterback. This project used Python as well as implementations of Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. To see this data story, click the image of the chart above.</p>

         <p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px; margin-top: 40px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">It was not until the spring of my sophomore year at the University of Pittsburgh that I learned all Pitt students were given access to the Adobe Creative Cloud with their enrollment. While I was thrilled to learn I had so many amazing resources at my fingertips, I was equally disappointed to see that I had missed out on using programs like Photoshop, After Effects, InDesign, and Illustrator in my first few semesters. I wanted to fix this lack of communication especially for students in a similar vein of study as me. To rectify this issue, I used Adobe InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop to build a PDF that guides students through the tedious process of downloading this amazing software. Since this PDF was tied to the University, I had to research and ensure I used the exact colors, fonts, and logos that cater to Pitt’s brand. This was an enjoyable yet challenging work for me that has assisted many students. Click the image above to see the PDF.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px; margin-top: 40px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">One of my passions and hobbies is motorsports. Ever since I was a child, I have always followed American motorsports. Unfortunately, in terms of ratings and popularity, American motorsports are not doing too well right now. To possibly plant the seed of motorsports fandom in my friends and classmates, I spent many hours in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator designing this infographic about the history of stock cars in NASCAR. I used many of the sports most iconic and recognizable cars to tells a quick story about American stock car racing. The types of cars in NASCAR are split into seven generations. Unfortunately, seven is not the easiest number to work with in graphic design. However, I found an arrangement that is eye pleasing. This project was a ton of fun to produce.</p>

   <p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px; margin-top: 40px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Continuing my passion for motorsports, I designed a PDF leading into the 2023 NASCAR season. This PDF highlights all 38 events on the 2023 NASCAR Cup Series schedule. Leading into the season, this PDF was great for fans who want to remember where and when the next race is. NASCAR’s 75th season recently wrapped up with Ryan Blaney hoisting the Bill France Cup. I plan to have an updated version of this PDF made in time for the 2024 season. Since the creation of this project, I have learned tons of tactics and skills to improve text, color, and other design elements. Click on the image above to view the full PDF.</p>
