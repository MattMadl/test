     <p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px; margin-top: 40px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">My inspiration for this project stems from my recent newfound interest in National Parks and environment conservation. I was inspired by multimedia works like Trevor Robert's Mystery Flesh Pit National Park. This bestiary was created as my final project for my my first of two capstone courses. The course had a heavy focus on english literature through the lens of animal studies. The Mason's Rift National Park world is a creation of of my own that explores the idea of an interdimensional national park. I plan to build upon this world with more projects spanning across various forms of digital media. Click the image above to see the bestiary.</p>

Through careful consideration, our group decided to develop the user interface for that we know college students would enjoy. Sizzle allows students to air out their complaints anonymously. We considered the idea that not all students may agree with each complaint, so we added a user affordance that allows for upvoting and downvoting. Each upvote makes the post heat up or “sizzle” and each downvote makes the post cool down or be doused. To learn more about this work, click on the image above.</p>

     <p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px; margin-top: 40px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">The 2021-22 NFL season was a one of intrigue for statistic gurus. I found it hard to believe the fact that a receiver that had statistically the greatest season of all time would be virtually ignored in voting for the most coveted seasonal award other than the Super Bowl itself. I explored stats using sites like Pro Football Reference to understand why it has become impossible for players to win the Most Valuable Player award without being a quarterback. This project used Python as well as implementations of Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. To see this data story, click the image of the chart above.</p>

     <h3 class="margin">Phase 2/3 Course Goals</h3>

  <h4><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">In this phase of the course, I spent more time thinking about what I wanted to create. We used tactics such as stasis theory to uncover our creative aspirations. It is often difficult to know what you want to create when you are thinking too broad. I came across this problem numerous times when doing research for our phase four projects. I also used random things I captured in photos or videos to serve as a starting platform for my creativity.</p>
     <br>
        <h4><em>2.	Engage with others in a workshop environment</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">I spent much more time getting to know my classmates over the last few weeks. Sharing ideas and goals is an excellent way to increase the quality and passion in your own work. It was interesting to learn what others were interested in and how it affected their work and projects. Some folks were passionate about music, dental health, cybersecurity, and much more. This made me want to focus my work more on something that I care about.</p>
      <br>
        <h4><em>3.	Think deeply about craft</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">Sometimes when I look at my own work, I don’t quite feel satisfied. When creating the interview project, I felt my voice, but the absence of my face was a problem. I thought about redoing the video from scratch, but I also thought it would be cruel to ask my friend to be interviewed again. Instead, I went a different route and used effects in Premiere Pro to use text as the questions. That way my awful voice could be cut out altogether.</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>4.	Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">I spent far more time doing research in this phase than the last. The final two projects had been looming over my head for awhile and I had no idea what I was going to do. Instead of letting this bother me, I attacked the task and used resources I had never used before in research such as Pitt’s library system. I asked myself questions about what I was reading. Originally, I referred back to these questions regularly, now I always am thinking about these essential questions in the back of my head when researching.</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">There were not as many presentation opportunities in the last few weeks as I would have thought. However, I still used opportunities discussing my research to present my work in a professional manner. As stated previously, we used stasis theory to come up with more concrete statements about our research. I used quick statements about my project to give a great first impression of my ideas onto my classmates.</p>

        <p>Leading up to the Interactive Installation final, I presented a slideshow detailing arguments over the impact that TikTok and other short-form content platforms have on mental health.</p>

  <h3>Phase 4 Course Goals</h3> <br>
  <br>

  <div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-4">
         <p><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Similar to phases two and three of this course, I used stasis theory to fine tune my creativity to fit a presentable lens. I decided to take inspiration from certain UI strengths of the very platforms I was studying. This allowed me to have a foundation for the style and aesthetic I was going for on my final projects. The UI toolkit for the Kiosk already started with a black appearance, thus limiting the number of changes I needed to make to maintain the aesthetic that my creativity demanded.</p>
      </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><em>2. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">We spent a great amount of time in the last few classes watching our fellow classmates’ presentations. Some had unique ideas that pushed boundaries. Some asked the audience for suggestions on how to apply techniques in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to their creative aspirations. All presentations were subject to questions, comments, and concerns, afterwards. I offered some of my feedback, and in return, some of my classmates’ ideas even inspired me to make changes to my presentation and interactive kiosk.</p>
      </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><em>3.	Think deeply about craft. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I spent a ton of time wondering if my opinions and findings came off as too objective in my work. To bridge this gap between objectivity and subjectivity, I injected a little bit of my personal experience into my slideshow presentation. I felt like I was able to level with my audience after explaining why my topic interests me. Upon further consideration, I decided to leave this part out of the interactive kiosk. Including background, I feel would be irrelevant, as the people using the kiosk are not seeing me speaking.</p>

      <p><em>4. Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Entering this phase of the course, most of my research had been completed. However, that is not to say I did not learn anything that I could apply to my work. After presenting, I was given more opportunities to ask classmates their own opinions on my topic. While I was by no means surfing the web or reading articles on short-form content at this point in the course, I was still learning from more personal accounts. Some classmates agreed with my previous research, some may have found my conclusions too extreme.</p>
      </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">This phase of the course was crucial in learning to present my work. Before a few weeks ago, I had never needed to give an in-person presentation on my own at Pitt. I debated writing down everything I would say onto my slides. This seemed like a bad idea. Instead, I gave myself a few bullet points that I could use to steer myself in the right direction. Doing so, I could present my work while maintaining eye contact with the audience and not bore them with my monotone reading.</p>
